files for Data Boot Camp Module 11 Data Collection Challege

## Challenge Overview
In this challenge I analyzed both news publications and weather data from Mars to answer the following questions:  

1. How many months exist on Mars? 

    #### There appear to be twelve months consisting of 112 to 194 days each. Online material (see below) indicates that there are 24 months on Mars, so further analysis is required. 

2. How many Martian day's worth of data are there? 

    #### The data indicates that there are 1867 Martian day's worth of data. 

3. Which month, on average, has the lowest temperature? The highest?

    #### On average, month 3 has the lowest temperature and month 8 has the highest temperature. 

4. Which month, on average, has the lowest atmospheric pressure? The highest?

    #### On average, month 6 has the lowest atmospheric pressure and month 9 has the highest atmospheric pressure. 

5. How many terrestrial days exist in a Martian year?

    #### The data indicates that there are roughly 686 earth days in a Martian year, which is similar to what is indicated online (see below).
